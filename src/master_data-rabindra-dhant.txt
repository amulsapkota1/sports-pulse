Despite winning the competition, family pressure to abandon the sport continued, as no one in his village was involved in sports. His parents frequently asked about his earnings, which was discouraging. Money was not his primary motivator; his passion for MMA pushed him to win a national-level amateur competition in India, qualifying him for the world championship. However, this required relinquishing his Nepali citizenship, which he was not ready to do, so he returned to Nepal to find other avenues. His dream of a world championship was shattered due to Nepal lacking an MMA association. Disappointed, he returned to Delhi for professional fights, which, despite low pay, instilled fearlessness. The Covid pandemic forced his return to Nepal, and after the lockdown, he struggled to find fights in India. He considered foreign employment but found that it would prevent him from continuing MMA. This is when he met **Diwiz Piya Lama**, a jiu-jitsu coach. Lama recognized Dhant's potential during sparring sessions and became his mentor, a turning point that Dhant credits for keeping him in MMA rather than working abroad.

The incident sparked a debate on Reddit regarding whether it was an early stoppage. Some users argued it saved Anshul from further brain damage, noting that he was unconsciously punched in the head. One user highlighted that if the opponent, Quillan Salkilld, had dropped hammer fists, Anshul could have ended up with dementia. Others, including Merab Dvalishvili, suggested it was an early stoppage, believing Anshul could have continued, as he was seen grabbing a single leg. Despite claims of early stoppage, many acknowledged that Anshul was knocked to the ground by a clean hit. The general sentiment was that Anshul looked like he could have gone on fighting, but the referee acted quickly after he fell hard. The quick TKO was seen as humiliating given the training involved. However, some users cited famous fighters like Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali also getting knocked out, arguing it's part of the sport. There was concern for Anshul's UFC contract, with some hoping for 1-2 more matches before he is cut. Given his status as a top prospect from India, a country UFC is keen on entering, some believed he might get another chance, especially if the finish was questionable. However, others thought it unlikely due to being dropped so quickly by a grappler in the dangerous Lightweight division."

One user labeled him "undisputed podcast champion" due to his frequent podcast appearances. This led to comments like "Big mouth and no work is truly an Indian thing". Several commenters noted that Anshul is 30, which is considered the peak age for UFC champions, and this early loss was a significant setback. It was hoped that he had "set the path to UFC" for future Indian talents. Some expressed concern about potential racism against Indians in MMA circles following the loss, though others dismissed this as "weak BS" and "edgelord" remarks. The topic of Indian athletes' physicality in combat sports was also debated, with some arguing that Indians lack the genetic potential or appropriate diet and infrastructure to compete at a high level, contrasting them with Dagestanis. Diet was specifically mentioned, with one user noting Nate Diaz is vegan, challenging the idea that veganism equals weakness. However, another responded that Indian kids grew up stunted. Some advocated for Indians to switch to wrestling, where they perform well. There were calls for UFC to give him more chances, or for him to fight in a promotion like One Championship before UFC."

Some attributed his defeat to systematic demilitarization of Indians over centuries, suggesting it would take generations to produce "stone cold Killers like the Dagestanis". Others pointed to his bouncing on his toes, leading to wasted energy and poor base for punches, as well as a lack of head movement. One user stated Anshul "got saved from more brain damage". The decision to stop the fight early was a major point of contention.

He got an education scholarship in Thailand, where he first came to Arete. During lockdowns, he established a successful MMA/Jiu-Jitsu gym and is considered one of the pioneers of Nepalese Jiu-Jitsu and MMA, having a fighter named **Aindra** in 1 FC. **Diz** serves as the guide for the trip. Nepali people are a diverse group with Tibetan, Indian, Buddhist, and Hindu backgrounds. First impressions of Nepal include unfamiliar writings and ropes with flags, similar to those seen on Mount Everest. The group first visited a gym called **The Pump**. **Rabindra Dhant** is mentioned as having an upcoming fight. Training at The Pump is described as hard work with good pacing, where everyone fights for every inch. The mats at the gym are jigsaw mats, which are less comfortable than cushy mats, causing mat burns and squeaky sounds. The amateur MMA fighters on the team have a top-heavy style, with less focus on sport techniques, which is effective in MMA where top control is crucial. Point-scoring positions common in traditional Jiu-Jitsu, like mount and side control, are not as conducive to MMA unless legs are tied up or leg-ridden. General athletic levels are high among the guys, with good cardio, speed, agility, and flexibility. The lack of belt grading in MMA is noted as a shame, but belts don't particularly matter in an MMA context."

During a traditional ritual, they encountered the slaughter of a goat and the cleaning of intestines, which involved "shite water". Nepal celebrates various holidays, including Eid, Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian festivals. A popular food item is Momo, a steam dumpling similar to Chinese/Japanese cuisine. Driving in Nepal is described as chaotic, with little regard for traffic signs or lights. The food, including a traditional Nepali meal called Takali (rice/barley with potato curry and lentil soup), was not to everyone's liking. There's significant cross-pollination between Indian and Nepali cultures, with no passport needed to cross the border. Kathmandu comprises three old towns, with monasteries attracting foreigners studying Buddhism. Nepali food is very diverse, and the group also tried grilled buffalo tongue and buffalo brain (which caused sickness). They also sampled a special rice whiskey and a wooden bong. **Diz** taught a class on body lock passing, noting the technical skills of the Nepali fighters. The group observed that the traffic in Kathmandu is on another level, with drivers constantly sneaking in. The challenges of managing an MMA scene in Nepal include cutthroat competition between gyms and the emotional toll of wins and losses. A photo from a previous fight shows **Rabindra Dhant** visibly frustrated after losing to a Pakistani guy named **Volcano**, but he later made a spectacular comeback in Kathmandu. There are plans for future trips to Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam."

He notes that while a core crowd for UFC and MMA existed before, his journey has led to a massive increase in people watching fights or attending NWC events, even if just as a hobby. Dhant mentions spending significant time outside Nepal for training, doing "up and down" trips for one to two months at a time. He finds living abroad enjoyable now, having gotten used to it despite initial loneliness and language barriers. His training is continuous and intense. Dhant is experiencing significant hype and good promotion on social media, with Nepali fans being very supportive in sports. He shares that during a fight in China, Brave's media team used his phone to post and collaborate on his social media because his WhatsApp and Instagram weren't working without a VPN. He sees himself as a pioneer for Nepalis reaching international big fight federations. Dhant believes MMA is advancing well in Nepal, with new talents emerging, particularly three to four individuals in his gym who have maintained consistent progress for 3-4 years and are expected to go pro soon. He reflects on his initial experience at Soma, where he felt unnoticed, but through hard work, gained recognition and support from coaches and fellow fighters. He attributes his strong confidence before a recent Brave fight to continuous training and a long wait for the fight, creating a hunger to compete. His disciplined diet and training with high-level fighters further boosted his confidence, as did the coaches' encouragement."

He acknowledges the pressure to maintain a clean record, fearing a second loss could hinder his progress to the top. He mentions his opponent's 8-1 record, indicating more professional experience. Dhant also talks about dealing with negative messages from others, who would say things like "Chinese are dangerous, they've been doing Kung Fu since childhood," requiring him to self-motivate. He counters this by recalling his own childhood of physical labor in Bajhang's mountains, believing he's equally capable. He emphasizes the significant role of the mental game in fights. He noticed his opponent lacked confidence by avoiding eye contact, which boosted Dhant's own self-assurance. Dhant advises that exercise benefits mental health, not just physical. He also touches on the perception of Nepal by foreigners, who might view it as mysterious or associated with black magic due to cultural unfamiliarity. Dhant's opponent had strong striking but weaker wrestling and grappling. He notes his own striking has improved significantly due to intense training at Soma, where striking and kickboxing sparring are emphasized. However, he feels a slight fear when striking in MMA because a single punch from a good striker could end the fight. He admits that a good punch landed early in a previous fight made him dizzy, prompting him to quickly go for a clinch. Dhant describes how his opponent studied his feints and timed a punch as he stepped in. His opponent also had a longer reach."

He mentions a big fight coming up in Delhi on August 2nd. After returning from Brave, he immediately signed up for this next fight, which was originally for someone else. He expresses excitement for fighting in Delhi, where he trained for three years and has many Indian friends. Dhant states that he and his team, including **Diwiz** and Mahendra, have managed his expenses for previous camps. For the upcoming camp, **Latido** will cover training camp expenses, and **Nutrition Fit Nepali** has been providing supplements for a year and a half. He emphasizes the significant impact of supplements, noting he feels weak and lacks power when he doesn't take them. His current diet is normal, consisting of rice, chicken, eggs, and fruits, unless he's cutting weight. His camp preparation is continuous, with 2-3 training sessions daily, making it a "camp-like" routine even when there's no immediate fight.

He found the saunas very intense during weight cut. He describes a challenging weight cut experience where he lost 4.5 kg in three hours through hot water, which was easier than the traditional sauna. He recalls the difficulty of sleeping without water after a cut, with his mouth drying up. He notes that at Brave, Chinese teams received preferential treatment in warm-up rooms over international fighters. After a fight, opponents sometimes take losses personally; Dhant recalls an opponent at Brave changing tables to avoid him during breakfast, unlike past experiences where fighters remained normal. He reflects on a past loss where his body was weak from a bad weight cut and rehydration, causing stomach pain during warm-up and making it hard to fight three rounds. He realized his loss immediately after the fight. The first loss was devastating, leading to deep thoughts about how to recover and win again, feeling immense pressure for the next fight. Dhant emphasizes the massive public support he received, particularly from Nepali fans, contrasting it with the toxic reactions seen in India after cricket losses. This support motivates him to work harder and make his supporters happy. He acknowledges the growing pressure and expectations from the public, especially as he becomes more famous beyond the MMA community. He feels the pressure of winning or losing, as many fans only understand results, not the technicalities or the arduous weight-cut process. Dhant manages pressure by focusing on the fight itself, trying to ignore distractions, and recalling past pain to prevent future losses. For pre-fight rituals, he watches vlogs of villages and mountains in Nepal to find peace, avoiding fight videos. He found social media restrictions in China helpful for focus. He played Candy Crush to pass time, completing 300 levels in 3-4 days. Social media doesn't affect him much now, as he's learned to handle it over time, finding it easier than if it had hit him suddenly. He credits **Diwiz** for immense mental support and guidance in controlling his mind."

He attributes his quiet nature and shyness to growing up in a village without many friends, spending time on household chores and studies, and being restricted by his parents from going out. He acknowledges the need to become more outspoken in the MMA field to promote himself. He's also working on his English to improve his public speaking for future international opportunities, recognizing its importance for promotion, citing fighters like Charles Oliveira and Alex Pereira. His training in Bali, where coaches and partners are mostly international, helps with English practice. Dhant's upcoming fight involves an opponent known for wrestling, suggesting a mix of striking and wrestling in a potentially long, five-round match (25 minutes), which would be his first. He finds the idea of 25 continuous minutes daunting but believes he will adapt. He explains that in sparring, he sometimes switches to defensive mode when tired, conserving energy. He recalls being extremely exhausted in the third round of his previous two three-round fights, realizing the challenge of a five-round bout. He trains with high-level sparring partners, including champions from UFC, PFL, and Brave. He aims to be a UFC champion, a dream shared by many fighters, and plans to fight until 33-34 years old, wishing for his mind and body to remain strong. He emphasizes the mental battles and financial concerns he faces. Dhant describes his life in Bali as mostly training, with occasional thoughts of leisure, but his focus quickly returns to his mission due to his family's and country's expectations. He maintains a disciplined routine of training, eating, and sleeping, which he feels is in a meditative stage. He doesn't watch movies but enjoys funny videos and analyzes opponent fights, without over-watching to avoid self-doubt. His hobbies include trekking in mountains and eating, especially ice cream, and Thali. He advises aspiring fighters to be prepared for getting hit, emphasize discipline in food, training, and rest, and cultivate mental resilience for inevitable injuries."

However, **Chungreng Koren**'s team, Warriors Cove, released a statement attributing Koren's performance issues to "a myriad of issues prior to the event," including his legs giving out hours before the fight. They claimed he refused to pull out multiple times and was surprised he made it to Round 3, praising his "never give up spirit" while still congratulating Rabindra. In response, **Coach Mike** (Dhant's head coach from Soma Fight Club, who also trains Anshul Jubli, Puja Tomar, and Punyajeet Likharu) vehemently criticized Warriors Cove's statement as "BS" and "fit for a Bollywood movie". Coach Mike argued that Indian MMA struggles because coaches refuse to accept losses and instead make excuses. He questioned Warriors Cove's history of missing weight, citing instances of 2.5 kg, 3 kg, and 5.5 kg misses by their fighters (Rekha Chaudhary, Sanjeet Budhwar, Mandeep Prajapati). He asserted that if Koren had weight-cut issues, it was their responsibility, and they failed to prep their fighter properly. Coach Mike emphasized that good coaches take losses silently, learn, and grow, blaming only themselves. He stated that Rabindra "simply outclassed" Koren in every aspect (wrestling, grappling, striking) and that Rabindra fought with an **MCL tear** in his knee, having not wrestled for six weeks. Coach Mike dismissed the idea of a rematch, saying Warriors Cove "simply don't deserve" one and that the loss will remain "permanently etched in history"."

He questioned why Warrior's Cove made excuses when Rabindra came in with a more significant injury. The host further criticized Indian MMA coaches for not analyzing performance issues but rather looking for excuses, echoing Coach Mike's sentiment. He noted that Coach Mike and his team, who also train **Anshul Jubli** and **Puja Tomar**, have never made excuses for their fighters' losses, even when injuries were present. The host highlighted the importance of sportsmanship, contrasting it with Warrior's Cove's statement that simultaneously congratulated Dhant and offered excuses. He cited Conor McGregor's respectful post-fight interview after losing to Nate Diaz as an example of how fighters should handle losses. The host dismissed the possibility of an immediate rematch for Koren, stating he needs to recover, improve his game, fight more, and earn wins before considering it. Coach Mike explicitly rejected a rematch, feeling that Warrior's Cove did not deserve one after their disrespectful response to the loss. The host concluded by emphasizing accountability, humility in defeat, and learning from mistakes for growth in Indian MMA, rather than making excuses. He pointed out that every fighter enters the ring with injuries, citing examples like broken toes and concussions, so excuses are invalid in such a hard sport. He hopes Indian teams and fighters will reflect on these issues and make improvements without needing external criticism."

The event featured five amateur fights and two professional fights, with **Rabindra Dhant** leading the charge. It was also Nepal's first ever Nepal vs. India MMA event, showcasing homegrown fighters. While MMA and boxing have been growing in Nepal over the last five years, the sport is still considered to be at a very basic level, needing the entire MMA community to come together. Before NWC, the fight scene in Nepal was lackluster; an organization called MMAN was formed in 2022, but only held two amateur events. Nepali fighters who wanted to compete professionally had to travel to India or neighboring countries. NWC was formed to fill this void for both amateur and professional fighters and to promote the sport. The NWC 1 event was announced on April 11, 2023. Fighters receive excellent treatment at NWC, with one fighter noting it was the best fight week experience he had received, praising the care from the NWC team. Fighters undergo medical checks and make weight the day before fights. **Rabindra Dhant** (5-0 record, representing Nepal) made his debut at NWC 1, winning against Indian fighter **Jason Lingo** (0-0 record) via Rear Naked Choke at 1:23 in Round 1. Dhant later made his debut in One Championship, winning against Russian fighter **Dorji Tongak**, a historic event for Nepalese MMA. The NWC aims to create a platform for Nepalese fighters regardless of their amateur or pro status, providing a competing platform, paying fighters what they deserve, and eventually taking them to a global stage."

His friend, **Sandesh Palungwa Limbu**, another MMA trainer, concurs. However, the sport is in its nascent phase in Nepal due to multiple problems, primarily a dearth of players. Young people often train for a couple of months and then leave, lacking the perseverance, dedication, and discipline MMA demands, especially in a country where youth prioritize securing their future. Limbu believes parents deter children from watching MMA due to its perceived aggression on television, but he emphasizes MMA as a safe sport for highly trained fighters. Limbu, who honed his skills in Vale Tudo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai in Australia, travels globally to learn and shares his knowledge with students in Nepal. **Cyrus Gurung**, 28, who has been learning MMA for seven years and teaches Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing at Rage Fitness since 2012, also finds it difficult for aspirants to turn professional without local competitions. He points out that competitions would provide a platform and income for fighters. Gurung stresses that becoming an MMA fighter requires years of dedication and discipline, not just imitating TV fights."

One user attributes the lack of popularity to government shortcomings, noting the absence of proper fight stadiums and the fact that Nepali athletes representing the country in karate have to work other jobs to support their families. Another user, himalayanZombie, counters that it's not solely the government's fault but also a lack of "fighting culture" in South Asia, unlike the prevalence of cricket, volleyball, and football. They acknowledge that while sports like Karate, taekwondo, and wrestling (in India) are somewhat popular, "real fighting sports like boxing, kickboxing or mma" are not. This user credits **Diwiz** with a bigger role in marketing and elevating **Rabindra Dhant** to his current status, stating Dhant would be where he is without **Sisan** but not without Diwiz. Other users confirm that MMA is slowly entering the mainstream in South Asia, following its earlier popularity in Japan, and that while Nepal previously had strong Taekwondo, the base for mixed martial arts like wrestling, judo, and kickboxing is not high-level. However, they note that MMA in Nepal is in a good spot with fighters being built. Another user (Expert-Commercial672) mentioned attending NWC4, where Dhant was the main event, describing it as "pretty epic" with a packed and enthusiastic crowd, and praising Diwiz for doing a "pretty good job"."

Other users corroborated that gyms in Nepal are expensive, even low-tier ones, with some mentioning rates of NPR 2,000-3,000 for basic gyms.

Kharibot Chowk has Fit Fitness for NPR 2,500/month. Pro Fitness in Kumaripati is also NPR 2,500/month. Gold Gym in Jawlakhel reportedly charges NPR 2,500-3,000/month with discounts for regulars. Gainz Garage in Kumaripati is considered a budget gym with a good vibe for NPR 2,500/month. Physique workshop was noted at NPR 2,500 or 3,000/month, especially if bargaining. Other gyms like Proton and Platinum in Ekantakuna/Mahalaxmisthan are more expensive, ranging from NPR 7,000/month to NPR 46,000 for 12 months. Some users suggested buying annual memberships for cheaper rates, or investing in home gym equipment like dumbbells and pull-up bars as a lifetime investment. The high prices are partly attributed to gyms trying to sell yearly packages, as many members stop attending after a few months. Compared to Indian cities, gym prices in Nepal are considerably higher for similar or lower quality."

Dhant, "The Tiger of Bajhang," is described as the pride of Nepal and its only true breakout star, known for his international experience and a recent badass knockout at Brave Combat Federation against a Chinese opponent. Koren, "The Indian Rhino," is the reigning MFN bantamweight champion, known for his ground and pound and "Donkey Kong punches". Dhant's keys to victory were to weather early pressure, pick his shots, counter effectively, and test Koren's cardio. In Round 1, Dhant achieved early mount, landing significant shots to Koren's head, causing swelling on Koren's face. Commentators observed that Koren looked " past their prime," suggesting Dhant was Koren's "first real test". The second round continued with Dhant in dominant positions, landing elbows and attempting submissions, with Koren struggling to defend. Despite a late choke attempt by Koren, Dhant defended well, surviving the round. The commentators noted Koren's heavy breathing and slow movement in Round 3, indicating he was "gassed". Dhant continued his barrage, eventually hurting Koren, leading to a knockout and making Dhant the new champion. This was seen as the biggest upset and the only knockout of the evening. Rabindra Dhant's team had even manifested this win through a rap video depicting his life story and him knocking out Koren. The final decision by referee Mark Goddard declared Rabindra Dhant the winner by knockout at 0:54 of Round 3."
